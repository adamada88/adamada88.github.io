      I'm a designer who helps companies build amazing products. I focus on design strategy, high-level user experience, beautifully-detailed user interface design, and interaction and motion prototyping. <strong>But more than just amazing products, I help build successful and sustainable companies.</strong>
    </p>

      Right now, I'm part of the amazing team at <a href="http://www.csdisco.com/" target="_blank">Disco</a>, helping lawyers win more cases and practice more law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Disco, I was at <a href="http://www.netspend.com/" target="_blank">NetSpend</a> for 4 years, where I designed distributed digital consumer and business banking products and experiences, and the platforms and patterns that powered them. I joined as one of the first product/experience designers. A couple years into my time there, the company was bought for $1.4B.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before NetSpend, I worked mostly with other startups — leading small, lean teams on big, juicy projects.

      <strong>I move fast and ship.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
      I talk to users and with leadership to make sure we're building the right things. I build products for the people that will use them. I listen to those people. I champion for those people. In the end, I design products that are incredibly beautiful, delightful, and engaging.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe that great design happens within constraints.</li>
      <li>I believe that products are made useful and valuable through collaboration.</li>
      <li>I believe that great products are simple and intuitive because of the thought, care, and expertise put into them.</li>
      <li>I believe there's time in every project to do something totally new.</li>
      <li>I believe there's a place in every project to use what we already know.</li>
      <li>I believe in designing to instill emotion.</li>
      <li>I believe in working with the best people I can find.</li>
    </ul>

      These are just a few of the things I've been working on recently, but I've got a ton more work, so if you're looking for something specific, just ask — there's a good chance I've encountered and solved for it or something similar along the way. Either way, I love talking about interesting projects and ideas!
