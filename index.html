      I'm a designer who helps companies build amazing products. I focus on software product design, including AI design, high-level user experience and design strategy, all the way down to beautifully-detailed user interface design, and interaction and motion prototyping.

    <p>
      For the last ~8 years, I've been at <a href="http://www.csdisco.com/" target="_blank">Disco</a>, where I've been responsible for the design of our flagship product, "Ediscovery", focusing primarily on AI, Search, and Review features and experiences that involve exposing petabytes of multidimensional data and billions of documents.
      <br><br>
      I joined Disco as one of the first product/software designers. A few years into my time there, the company went public with a ~$2B USD valuation and I stayed on for a few more years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Disco, I was at <a href="http://www.netspend.com/" target="_blank">Netspend</a> for ~4 years, where I was responsible for design across multiple banking platforms; products ranged from traditional consumer banking products and small business offerings to corporate incentive programs and other product offerings in the financial space.
      <br><br>
      I worked across mobile apps, tablet interfaces, and the full web experiences, across several product lines and feature sets. A couple years into my time there, the company was acquired for ~$1.5B USD and I stayed on for a couple more years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Netspend, I spent ~6 years working mostly with other startups, on a variety of challenging problems in interesting spaces. Happy to chat more if interested.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>I believe that great design is always possible, even within great constraints</li>
      <li>I believe in working with the best people I can find</li>
