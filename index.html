      I'm a designer who helps companies build amazing, inspiring products. I focus on design strategy, high-level user experience, beautifully-detailed user interface design, and interaction and motion prototyping. <strong>But more than just products, I help build successful and sustainable companies.</strong>

      Most recently, I've been a principal designer at NetSpend for four years. I joined as one of the first product designers. Around my second year, the company was bought for $1.4B. Now, the team has grown to more than twenty designers, whose work benefits millions of customers every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      At NetSpend, I lead the design of our distributed in-browser and in-app banking products and the platforms and patterns that power them. Before this, I worked with mostly startups, leading small, lean teams, on big, exciting projects.

      <strong>I move fast and ship.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    I talk to users and with leadership to make sure we're building the right things. I build products for the people that will use them. I listen to those people. I champion for those people. In the end, I design products that are incredibly beautiful, delightful, and engaging.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I believe that great design happens within constraints.</li>
      <li>I believe that products are made useful and valuable through collaboration.</li>
      <li>I believe that great products are simple and intuitive because of the thought, care, and expertise put into them.</li>
      <li>I believe there's time in every project for innovation.</li>
      <li>I believe there's a place in every project to reuse and iterate.</li>
      <li>I believe in design that instills emotion.</li>
      <li><strong>I believe in working with the best people I can find.</strong></li>

      In my experience, there are usually several solutions to any given problem. Below, you'll find a few of the most recent problems brought by the business and links to some project deliverables.
    </p>
    <div class="divide"></div>
    <p>
      <strong>Business problem:</strong> "Adam, we've increased conversion rates thanks to the new acquisition experience your team designed, but are really struggling to retain cardholders. If we could hold onto cardholders for even just one month longer, we'd make an extra $30M in revenue each quarter."
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Solution 1:</strong> Taking advantage of our advanced print and production facilities, allow new prospects and existing cardholders alike, a patented, best-in-class debit card customization experience.

    <p>
      <strong>Solution 2:</strong> Leverage our existing 5% cash back savings accounts and position ourselves in the space, aspirationally, as the best way to save money, by redesigning our savings and budgeting capabilities to live up to that claim.

    <div class="divide"></div>
    <p>
      <strong>Business problem:</strong> "We're constantly communicating key features to our users, but when we talk to them, they say they didn't know about them. What can we do?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Solution 1:</strong> Design a messaging framework and set guiding principles.

    <p>
      <strong>Business problem:</strong> "It seems like it takes longer than it should to spin up partner whitelabels, launch new features across touchpoints, and fix bugs. How can we get faster?"
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Solution:</strong> Design and Engineering invest in platform teams and pattern libraries.

      Products, platforms, systems, features, integrations, patterns, proofs, concepts, apps, sites, digital, you name it. I design experiences of all kinds. If you're interested in seeing something specific, all you have to do is ask. I love talking about interesting projects and ideas.
